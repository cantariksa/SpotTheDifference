This is a "Spot the Difference" game. 
This uses inspiration, images, and music from the game Animal Crossing New Horizons. All copyrights reserved to Nintendo. 
This game is not for distribution or sale, only for the use of the final project for the course Creative Progamming in Leiden University (2021, Fall Semester) for student Cania Antariksa (s2729768).
All images were created by myself using the game.
The song "Welcome Horizons" is copyrighted to Animal Crossing, Nintendo.
All other sounds in the game are subject to Creative Commons License.

How the application works:
- There are three levels, each level with an additional difference of difficulty, starting from 5 differences.
- For each level the player needs to find all the differences. When found, it is indicated by a green circle. The differences are only found when clicking on the right-side image.
- After all three levels are done, the player has the option to restart.
- When the timer is up, the player has the chance to restart from the current level they are on.

Some caveats:
- The game is best played with a mouse.
- The game is quite large in canvas size due to the quality of the images. Reducing it any further risks the player not being able to see differences between the two images, so the game is best played in 1600x600 canvas size.
- The timer of the game cannot be increased beyond 100 seconds due to some overflow calculations with the timer bar. So the game is left at 100 seconds (which should be enough).

Enjoy, and have fun playing the game as much as I enjoyed making it! :D
